				<h2 id="top-header">Writing an siduction ISO to a USB stick, SSD card, SDHC device with any Linux, MS Windows&#8482; or Mac OS X&#8482;  Operating System</h2>

							<p>No matter what operating system you use, the following methods will enable you to install a siduction ISO to a USB-Stick, SSD card, SDHC device, (Secure Digital High Capacity card).</p>

							<p>The siduction ISO image is written to the device and while persist is not possible, it does allow you to have siduction-on-a-stick. </p>

							<p>If persist is a requirement, install-usb-gui is not subject to these limitations and therefore is the recommended option where an existing siduction system is available, refer to <a href="hd-install-opts-en.htm#usb-from1">USB/SSD fromiso Installation - siduction-on-a-stick</a>.</p>

					   <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
						 <ul>
							<li><span class="highlight-3">Ensure that the BIOS on the PC that you wish to boot with siduction-on-a-stick/card can actually boot up USB-Sticks or SSD cards. This is usually any PC that has a USB 2.0 or 3.0 protocol and supports booting from USB/SSD.</span></li>

							<li>The USB/SSD should be recognised automatically and you should see the <span class="highlight-3">F4</span> menu option will say <span class="highlight-3">Hard Disk</span>, otherwise invoke <span class="highlight-3">F4 &gt;Hard Drive</span> or add <span class="highlight-3">fromhd</span> to the boot menu bootline.</li>

							<li><span class="highlight-2">It is important to note that the following methods will overwrite and destroy any existing partition table of the targeted media. Data loss will depend on size of the siduction-*.iso. It does not restrict the available storage as far as Linux is concerned and you may be able to regain any data left that the ISO has not wiped out, however MS Windows seems to only allow one partition. So please be safe and do not do this to your 100+- gig hardrive!</span></li>

			    <h3>Linux Operating Systems</h3>

							<p>Plug in your USB-Stick or card reader with the card you wish to write to and:</p>
<pre>
cat /path/to/siduction-*.iso > /dev/USB_raw_device_node
</pre>
							<p>or</p>
<pre>
dd if=/path/to/siduction-*.iso of=/dev/sdX
</pre>
<p>To find out, what the X in sdX represents in your case, run the <i>fdisk -l</i> command.</p>
					<h6>Example:</h6>

							<p>Plug in your device run <span class="highlight-3">dmesg</span> and look at the output:</p>

<pre>
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdf] Assuming drive cache: write through
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdf] Assuming drive cache: write through
sdf: sdf1 sdf2
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdf] Assuming drive cache: write through
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdf] Attached SCSI removable disk
</pre>
							<p>Assuming an ISO called <span class="highlight-3">siduction-11.1-OneStepBeyond--i386-2011xxxxx</span> was downloaded, (you could rename it to <span class="highlight-3">siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso</span>), then the command to run will be:</p>

<pre>
cat /home/username/siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso > /dev/sdf
</pre>
							<p>or</p>
<pre>
dd if=/home/username/siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso of=/dev/sdf
</pre>

							<p>The USB/SSD should be recognised automatically and you should see the <span class="highlight-3">F4</span> menu option will say <span class="highlight-3">Hard Disk</span>, otherwise invoke <span class="highlight-3">F4 &gt;Hard Drive</span> or add <span class="highlight-3">fromhd</span> to the boot menu bootline.</p>

	<div class="divider" id="raw-ms">
			    <h3>MS Windows&#8482; Systems</h3>

							<p>This is fast and simple. Install a program called <a href="http://shounen.ru/soft/flashnul/">flashnul</a>, (<a href="http://shounen.ru/soft/flashnul/#download">download page</a>).</p>

							<p>Note the name of 'flashnul' when you extract and install because it may show as a folder called flashnul-x.x, (for example, 'flashnul-1rc1.zip' downloaded, extracted and installed in Program Files has a folder called flashnul-1rc1, which will have a folder inside that one called flashnul-1rc1, which in turn, contains the flashnul program and associated files/folders and therefore will be used in throughout this example.)</p>

							<p>Plug in your stick/card.</p>

							<p>If you extracted and installed flashnul to Program Files and you are not sure of where the USB-Stick is mounted, study the output from 'flashnul -p' by clicking <span class="highlight-3">run</span> from the menu, then typing <span class="highlight-3">cmd</span> to bring up the terminal then change directories to the flashnul program folder that contains all individual files of the program, in this case:</p>
<pre>
cd C:\Program Files\flashnul-1rc1\flashnul-1rc1\
flashnul -p
</pre>
							<p>The output should show something like:</p>
<pre>
Available physical drives:
0       size = 60022480896 (55 Gb))
1       size = 2003828736 (1911 Mb)
</pre>
							<p>Assuming an ISO called <span class="highlight-3">siduction-11.1-OneStepBeyond--i386-2011xxxxx</span> was downloaded, (you could rename it to <span class="highlight-3">siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso</span>), cut and paste, (or copy it), to the flashnul-1rc1 folder that contains all individual files/folders of the program.</p>

							<p>As the output example of 'flashnul -p'  showed the USB Device as being mounted on <span class="highlight-2">1</span>, type in the following and hit the enter key, (administrator privileges may be required):</p>
<pre>
flashnul 1 -L siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso
</pre>

							<p>MS Win7 may need the actual drive letters specified, for example the D: and c:\ drives:</p>
<pre>
flashnul D: -L c:\flash\siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso
</pre>

							<p>The USB/SSD should be recognised automatically and you should see the <span class="highlight-3">F4</span> menu option will say <span class="highlight-3">Hard Disk</span>, otherwise invoke <span class="highlight-3">F4 &gt;Hard Drive</span> or add <span class="highlight-3">fromhd</span> to the boot menu bootline.</p>
	</div>
    	<div class="divider" id="raw-mac">
				<h3>Mac OS X&#8482; Systems</h3>

							<p>Insert your usb device, Mac OS X should automatically mount it. In the Terminal (found in Applications &gt; Utilities folders), run:</p>
<pre>
diskutil list
</pre>

							<p>Ascertain what your usb device is called and then unmount the partitions on the device (let us assume /dev/disk1):</p>
<pre>
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
</pre>
							<p>Assuming an ISO called <span class="highlight-3">siduction-11.1-OneStepBeyond--i386-2011xxxxx</span> was downloaded, to <span class="highlight-3"> /Users/username/Downloads/</span>, (you could rename it to <span class="highlight-3">siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso</span>) and if the USB Device is designated as <span class="highlight-3">disk1</span>, run:</p>
<pre>
dd if=/Users/username/Downloads/siduction-11.1-onestepbeyond.iso of=/dev/disk1
</pre>

							<p>The USB/SSD should be recognised automatically and you should see the <span class="highlight-3">F4</span> menu option will say <span class="highlight-3">Hard Disk</span>, otherwise invoke <span class="highlight-3">F4 &gt;Hard Drive</span> or add <span class="highlight-3">fromhd</span> to the boot menu bootline.</p>
