<h1>Release Notes for siduction 2012.2 - Riders on the Storm</h1>
<p>We are very happy to present to you the final release of siduction 2012.2 - <i>Riders on the Storm</i>. Siduction is a distribution based on Debian's unstable branch and we try to release snapshots quarterly.</p>
<p>Siduction 2012.2 is shipped with 4 Desktop-Environments: KDE SC, XFCE, LXDE and Razor-qt,  all in 32- and 64-bit variants. Razor-Qt is the latest flavour that joins our regular release cycle after seeing a dev-release in the summer.</p>
<p>The released images are a snapshot of Debian unstable, that also goes by the name of sid, from 2012-12-09. They are enhanced with some useful packages and scripts, our own installer and a custom patched version of the linux-kernel 3.6-9, accompanied by XServer 1.12.4-4.</p>
<p>As the freeze for Debian 7 aka Wheezy will still last some months, we take the opportunity to update and consolidate our package-base with this new release.</p>
<h3>What is new</h3>
<p>Other than updated packages and fresh artwork we ship some more novelties, some in the open, others hidden.</p>
<p>We have fixed a number of bugs that turned up in RC1 and RC2. Thank you for submitting them</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs from RC1</li>
<li>The bluewater manual is now available in romanian language, closes #998</li>
<li><i>fw-detect</i> works again as expected for installing non-free firmware</li>
<li>Creation of <i>sources.list</i> during building the images got an overhaul, closes #997</li>
<li>new upstrem for <i>wbar</i>, <i>wbar-config</i> added, closes #978</li>
<li>added correct firmware-link for AR7010+AR9287 devices to <i>fw-detect</i></li>
<li>switched to kickoff menu for KDE</li>
<li>fixed VG default size of 4 GB for LVM, closes #974 </li>
<li>added <i>ntfs-config</i> for easier configuration of ntfs file system</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bugs from RC2</li>
<li>added romanian language-support and translation in the appropriate places like grub/gfxboot, installer and language switcher (qxkb)</li>
<li>removing a lock from Chromium after install</li>
<li>fixed some regressions introduced with fixes from RC1</li>
</ul>
<p>Razor-qt, first released in a dev-release in the summer, will now move as a new flavour to our regular release cycle. The Razor-qt team has recently released <a href="http://news.siduction.org/2012/10/yay-razor-qt-0-5-released/">Razor-qt 0.5.1</a>, which we integrate in our release. Razor-qt Desktop-Environment is not finished yet, but the 0.5 release was a big step to more completion.</p>
<p>XFCE in Debian unstable, due to the freeze for the wheezy release, still is on version 4.8. We have, for this release, packaged and shipped <a href="http://news.siduction.org/2012/10/xfce-4-10-for-siduction/">XFCE 4.10</a> for our users.</p>
<p></p> LXDE has 2 new packages: <i>lxpolkit</i>, which is LXDE's own polkit package, and <i>lxappearance-obconf</i>, which is a openbox configuration plugin for lxappearance.
<p>The debian-qt-kde team has backported the changes in versions 4.8.4 to 4.8.5 into 4.8.4-5. So the shipped version 4.8.4-5 is basicaly 4.8.5.</p>
<p>A lot of time consuming changes again went into adapting the codebase we forked to our needs. We found the way how artwork was integrated into the different flavours for each release very cumbersome and have reshaped the process. The same thing is happening to the bluewater manual at the moment. The process of adding new pages needs an overhaul to simplify the process. All in all <a href="http://chili.siduction.org/projects/siduction/versions/13">we closed 118 bugs</a> since the last final release, most of them being code rewrites.</p>

<p>Besides that we have received a much needed webserver from a member of the core-team as a donation and have set it up accordingly. Many thanks for that.</p>
<p> The installer still offers <i>btrfs</i> as an experimental filesystem. Please be careful if you use it and always backup your data.</p>

<p>Support can be obtained on our forum as well as on IRC. The relevant channels on
OFTC-Network are <i>#siduction</i> for english support or <i>#siduction-core</i>, if
you like to join in and participate. On your desktop you also find an icon that takes
you to the right channel for support, depending on the chosen language.</p>

<p>To be able to act as a testbed for Debian, we are introducing our own bug-tracker.
Let me explain how you can help us and Debian by submitting bugreports for broken
packages. Weathered users will know how to file bugs directly with the Debian BTS
(Bug Tracking System). For users not so comfortable with the system we have
 <i>reportbug-ng</i> preinstalled.</p>
<p>If you think, you found a bug in a Debian package,
please start <i>reportbug-ng</i> and put the name of the package in the adressline on
top. The app will now search through the already filed bugs for that package and show
those. Now it's up to you to determine, if "your" bug has already been reported. If
it is, ask yourself if you have anything relevant to add to this report or maybe even a
patch. If not, you are done for this time. If the bug has not been reported yet
and you are not familiar with the BTS yet, you may report the bug in our
<a
href="http://chili.siduction.org/projects/newsid-verwaltung/issues/new">
Bug-Tracker.</a></p>
<p>That obviously goes for siduction packages as well. We will sort the bugs for you
and file them in the appropriate place, if it's reproducible. Please look out for
a forum post with more detailed info on the bug-tracker soon. If all this seems
to complicated for now, feel free to use the bugs-thread on the forum for now,
it will keep working until final release.</p>

<p>Should you have wondered, where the codename 'Riders on the Storm' comes from, let
me tell you that we name our releases after famous rocksongs. 'Riders on the Storm'
is a song from LA Woman by The Doors.</p>
<p>Speaking of release and our planned release cycle. There is
nothing we can tell you other than that we strive for 4 releases per year.</p>
<p>As we are always looking for contributors, here is what to do: Come to IRC to
channel <i>#siduction-core</i> and talk to us about what you would like to do within
the project, or where you think you could help.</p>
<br /><br />
<h3>Hardware Tips</h3>
<p>If you should own a ATI Radeon graphics accelerator, please use the failsafe option, when booting the Live-ISO. This option will add
the cheatcodes <i>radeon.modeset=0 xmodule=vesa</i> to the Kernel bootline, so that you can boot to X. Before installing, on the Live-ISO, please install firmware-linux-nonfree.
To do so, please open your <i>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</i> with your
favourite editor as root and append <i>contrib non-free</i> to the end of the first
line. Save the edit and do:
<pre>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree</pre> If you install the operating system now, the package will be installed also,
preventing you from a garbled screen when first rebooting. Mind that if you reboot
before installing the system, the changes you made will be lost.</p>
<p>If your system has wireless network, this will probably not work out of the box
with free drivers, so you better start with wired network connected. You might want
to use the script <i>fw-detect</i> to get information on wireless drivers. The
installer will prompt you for any missing firmware and guide you through the process
of installing it.</p><br />
