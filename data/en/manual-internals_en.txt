== Notes for Authors ==

=== The Syntax of the Articles===
Articles can be written in HTML or in wiki syntax.
The syntax is the same as used in WikiMedia (the engine behind Wikipedia)

Articles written in HTML must have the file extension .htm, Wiki articles have .txt.

Wiki articles start with the key word "mediawiki".
