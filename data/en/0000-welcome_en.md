% Siduction Manual

# Welcome

**The siduction™ GNU/Linux operating system**.

The name **siduction** is a wordplay of two terms: The word **sid**, meaning the code name of Debian Unstable, and **seduction**, meaning to seduce.

siduction is an operating system based on the [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org) and the [GNU project](https://gnu.org). In addition there are application programs from [Debian](https://debian.org). siduction is committed to the core values of the [Debian Social Contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract.en.html) and the following "*Debian Free Software Guidelines*".  
See also [DFSG](https://ee.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines)

### General

For those who want to get started quickly, here is the [Quick Start Guide](./wel-quickstart_en.md#siduction-short-guide)

The siduction operating system manual is a reference for getting to know the system as well as for refreshing your knowledge of the system. It not only provides basic knowledge, but also covers complex topics and supports the work as an administrator of siduction systems.

It is divided into similar topics: Everything concerning partitioning, for example, is in the "Installation/Partitioning" chapter, and topics concerning WLAN are in the "Network" chapter.

Printing manual pages:  
Linux commands can be more than 120 characters long. For an optimized display on the screen, there is no automatic line break. Our manual in PDF format, which is available on all ISO's and after installation in the system, uses line breaking for the long commands. It is also available [online here](https://manual.siduction.org/manual.pdf).  
To print manual pages, please use the PDF and print only the pages you need.

To get help for a specific pre-installed or self-installed application program (also called a package), it is best to consult the FAQs, online manuals or forums on the home page or help menu of the application.

Almost all application programs offer assistance by means of an associated "*Manual-Page*" (short manpage). It is called in the terminal by the command **`man <package name>`**. You can also check if there is documentation in */usr/share/doc/\<packagename\>*.
