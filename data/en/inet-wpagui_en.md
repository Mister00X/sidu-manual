## Using wpa_gui

wpa_gui provides a Qt GUI interface for wpa_supplicant and enables you to choose which configured network to connect to. It also provides a method for browsing 802.11 SSID scan results, an event history log of messages generated by wpa_supplicant and a method to add or edit wpa_supplicant networks.

wpa_gui is contained in the package wpagui.

**`Before trying to use wpa_gui you need either to use  [ceni to set up a basic config](inet-ceni-en.htm)  or take a few moments to set up some config files with  [Setting up for WiFi Roaming with wpa](inet-setup-en.htm) .`** 

`You will most likely need non-free firmware to be available on a USB-stick to install on the operating system. Please refer to  [non-free firmware debs on a stick](nf-firm-en.htm#fw-detect) .` 

## Using the GUI interface wpa_gui

You can start the wpa_gui from the menu, or if you prefer the cli, as user with $ /usr/sbin/wpa_gui.

When starting wpa_gui for the first time the default screen is:

![First Screen](../images-common/images-wpa-roam/wpa-gui-0.01.png "First Screen") 

To find what WiFi networks are available click on `Scan`  to bring up a list of available networks.

![Scanning](../images-common/images-wpa-roam/wpa-roam-04.png "Scanning") 

Doubleclick on the network you want to add which will bring up this screen:

![Enter passphrase and add](../images-common/images-wpa-roam/wpa-roam-05.png "Enter passphrase and add") 

Add the required passphrase to enable access and click on `add` :

If you are happy and everything is working, you can add the settings to `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf`  by choosing `File > Save Configuration` .

After the initialisation of wpa_gui, the `known added networks`  within range will show from the Network drop down box:

![The interface](../images-common/images-wpa-roam/wpa-roam-01.png "The interface") 

<!--Click on `Connect`  to access the network.

-->
In a 'roaming mode' you will need to restart the scan process.
