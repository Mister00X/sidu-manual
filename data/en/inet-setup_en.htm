		<h2 id="top-header">Setting up for WiFi Roaming with wpa</h2>
						      <p><span class="highlight-3">You will most likely need non-free firmware to be available on a USB-stick to install on the operating system. Please refer to <a href="nf-firm-en.htm#non-free-firmware"> non-free firmware debs on a stick</a>.</span></p>

					  <h3>Overview</h3>

							<p>wpa-roaming is a method with which you can browse and connect to wireless networks <span class="highlight-3">with and/or without a graphical desktop environment</span>.</p>

							<p>The result of the following set up is that if an ethernet cable is not attached, wlan0 takes precedence and connects you to your desired wireless network or to an available open wireless network or a predetermined wireless network. If you connect an ethernet cable, the cabled network connection immediatly shuts down WiFi access and eth0 then connects you to the cabled network. By unplugging the network cable the wireless connection will instantly be available again.</p>

				<h3>Setting up the network configuration</h3>

							<p>As <span class="highlight-3">root</span> adapt your <span class="highlight-3">/etc/network/interfaces</span> file so that it looks like this. (the name of the interface may be varied):</p>

<pre>
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback


#Added by user
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
  wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf

#this line must always be here
iface default inet dhcp
</pre>
							<p>Next wpa_supplicant needs a .conf file, wpa-roam.conf</p>

<pre>
cp /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/examples/wpa-roam.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf
</pre>
							<p>Use a text editor to open the file</p>
<pre>
&lt;editor&gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf
</pre>

							<p>Uncomment line 30 (remove the <span class="highlight-2">#</span>). This must be done otherewise configs will not be saved to file:</p>
<pre>
update_config=1
</pre>
							<p>To set up a laptop or a desktop that only needs to access a secured network immediately, uncomment lines, (remove the <span class="highlight-2">#</span>),for WPA-WPA2PSK as applicable: </p>

						
							<p>WPA example:</p>
<pre>
network={
	ssid="siduction_Worldwide" #Example WPA Network
	psk="mysecretpassphrase"
}
</pre>

							<p>The next step secures wpa-roam.conf from unwanted access. This is necessary, because secret keys of private networks are saved in this file:</p>

<pre>
chmod 600 /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf
</pre>

							<p>Bring up the wireless connection</p>
<pre>
ifup wlan0
</pre>
							<p>Next check to see if you are connected to the network:</p>


<pre>
wpa_cli status
</pre>
							<p>The output should look someting like this:</p>
<pre>
Selected interface 'wlan0'
bssid=94:0c:6d:aa:f4:42
ssid=siduction_Melbourne
id=3
pairwise_cipher=CCMP
group_cipher=CCMP
key_mgmt=WPA2-PSK
wpa_state=COMPLETED
ip_address=192.168.1.102
</pre>
							<p>If you can not see ip_address= numbers you are not connected so recheck the configs by first stopping wlan0:</p>

<pre>
wpa_action wlan0 stop
</pre>
							<p>Should you require specialised networking configs see <a href="#net-set3">here</a></p>

		</div>
		<div class="divider" id="net-set2">
				<h2>To enable switching between wired and wireless networks</h2>
							<p>First see <a href="inet-ifplug-en.htm">Switching between cable and wireless</a> because if its not set up correctly switching and connection to the network will not happen.</p>

							<p>After setting up ifplugd the final config should look like this: </p>
<pre>
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# governed by ifplugd ... do not use allow-hotplug or auto options
iface eth0 inet dhcp

#Added by user
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
  wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf

#this line must always be here
iface default inet dhcp
</pre>

		</div>
		<div class="divider" id="net-set3">
				<h2>Using wpa-roam.conf with manually specified network configurations</h2>

							<p>With the help of <span class="highlight-3">IDString</span> and <span class="highlight-3">Priority</span> you can direct to which network the box is connected at boot time. Highest priority is <span class="highlight-3">1000</span>, lowest priority is <span class="highlight-3">0</span>. You have to add the <span class="highlight-3">id_str</span> to <span class="highlight-3">/etc/network/interfaces</span> as well.</p>

						<h6>The syntax for /etc/network/interfaces.</h6>
							<p>First is for the connection to DHCP servers, the second is if you are provided with a fixed IP address. To adjust your settings:</p>
<pre>
# id_str="home_dhcp"
iface home_dhcp inet dhcp

#this line must always be here
iface default inet dhcp

# id_str="home_static"
iface home_static inet static

        address 192.168.0.20
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.0.0

        broadcast 192.168.0.255
        gateway 192.168.0.1
</pre>
						<h6>Practical Examples</h6>
							<p>If you want to be automatically connected to your home WLAN when  at home, give the the IDString "home" and priority "15". If you are travelling, and want the laptop to connect to any free, non passworded network which is available, give it the IDString "stalk" and priority "1" (very low). But please, always check if your connection is legal and disconnect if it is obviously not intended to be free.</p>

							<p>Example stanzas in /etc/network/interfaces:</p>
<pre>
# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)

# The loopback interface
# automatically added when upgrading
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
  wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf

#this line must always be here
iface default inet dhcp

iface home inet dhcp
iface stalk inet dhcp
</pre>


							<p>Example /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf (SSID and passwords are changed or just explained):</p>
<pre>
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="my_ssid"
        scan_ssid=1
        psk=123ABC  ##here comes the passphrase in hexadecimal code!!
#       psk="password_in_ascii"   ##you dont need to
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        pairwise=TKIP
        group=TKIP
        auth_alg=OPEN
        priority=15
        id_str="home"
}

network={
        ssid=""
        scan_ssid=1
        key_mgmt=NONE
        auth_alg=OPEN
        priority=1
        disabled=1   ## no automatic connection, one needs wpa_cli or wpa_gui
        id_str="stalk"
}
</pre>

							<p>With "disabled=1" you will not be automatically connected to a defined network block (open WLANs), you have to initiate roaming through wpa_gui or wpa_cli. For automatic roaming don't use the option at all or comment the line with the "disabled" option using a #.</p>

				<h3>Notes</h3>

					<h6>1. Easy to reuse</h6>

							<p>Once set up, you can easily reuse your setup on other laptops or desktops with WLAN cards. Just copy /etc/network/interfaces (adjust the name of the interface if needed) and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf to your new box. There is no need of "installing" anything after that.</p>

					<h6>2. Backup</h6>

							<p>It is a good idea to backup /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf, but <span class="highlight-3">encrypt your backup because it contains sensitive information</span>.</p>

							<p>A good method to safely backup and encrypt the config files is with tar and gpg. As root:</p>

<pre>
tar -cf- /etc/network/interfaces /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa-roam.conf  |  gpg -c > backup_name.tar.gpg
</pre>
							<p>A file has now been created in $ HOME:<br />
							backup_name.tar.gpg</p>

							<p>To list the contents of the backup_name.tar.gpg file:</p>

<pre>
gpg -d -o - backup_name.tar.gpg  | tar vtf -
</pre>
							<p>To extract and decrypt the contents of the archive backup_name.tar.gpg file:</p>

<pre>
gpg -d -o - backup_name.tar.gpg  | tar vxf -
</pre>

					<h6>3. Hidden SSIDs</h6>
							<p>Hidden SSIDs are detected when <span class="highlight-3">scan_ssid=1</span> is defined in the network block.</p>

			<h2>Basic wireless modem/router security</h2>

							<p>Where you have control of the wireless router/modem, there are a few basic security policies to implement to help protect your side of the network from intruders.</p>

					<h6>Basic protocol choices</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>WPA2-PSK is the better option.</li>
							<li>For encryption protocol choose AES.</li>
							<li>The passphrase should be really strong.</li>
						</ul>


					  <h6>Passphrase / passwords</h6>
							<p>For a passphrase/password that is strong and not really able to be memorised, use pwgen in a terminal (also read: man pwgen):</p>

<pre>
$ pwgen -s 63 1
VltnfGmGKXovVv2rmrCFFXBZ55Mij5bA6WytVJnVoKUqRn6dfjldG6MBrRo0Cdi
</pre>
						  <ul>
							<li>-s = secure (no mnemonics)</li>
							<li>63 = amount of characters</li>
							<li>1 = only generate one random password</li>

						  </ul>
							<p>Without the -s you get speaking type passwords. however it is unlikley you would want that:</p>
<pre>
$ pwgen 8 3
Sooxae2s Niew9ugh Hi7eeloo
</pre>
							<p>Once you have generated the passphrase/password store it in a text file on a USB-stick and apply the passphrase/password to the other computers that use your wireless network. Do not store the passphrase/password on your computer.</p>

						<h6>Example of final router setup:</h6>
