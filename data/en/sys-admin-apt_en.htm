		<h3>What does APT mean?</h3>
 							<p>APT is short for Advanced Packaging Tool and is a collection of programs and scripts that help both the sysadmin (in your case root) with the installation and management of deb-files but equally the system itself to know what is installed.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="divider" id="sources-list">
			<h2>Sources List</h2>
							<p>The "APT" -system needs a config-file that contains information about the locations of the installable and upgradeable packages and is commonly referred to as a <span class="highlight-3">sources.list</span>.</p>

							<p> Sources are contained in a directory or folder named: <br />
							<span class="highlight-3">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</span></p>

							 <p>Inside the folder are 2 files called:<br />
							<span class="highlight-3">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</span> and<br />
							<span class="highlight-3">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/siduction.list  </span></p>

							<p>This has the benefit of easier (automated) mirror switching, and makes it safer to replace lists.</p>

							<p>You can also add your own <span class="highlight-3">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list </span>files</p>


 			<h3>All siduction ISOs use the following sources as default:</h3>

<pre>
#Freie Universit√§t Berlin/ spline (Student Project LInux NEtwork), Deutschland 
ftp://ftp.spline.de/pub/siduction/iso 
rsync://ftp.spline.de/siduction/iso <br />
deb ftp://ftp.spline.de/pub/siduction/base unstable main 
deb ftp://ftp.spline.de/pub/siduction/fixes unstable main 
deb-src ftp://ftp.spline.de/pub/siduction/base unstable main
deb-src ftp://ftp.spline.de/pub/siduction/fixes unstable main 
</pre>

							<p>Further entries for optional siduction repositories are found at  <a href="http://packages.siduction.org">siduction repositories</a></p>
							<p>Adding several more Debian repositories could look like:</p>
<pre>
#Debian
# Unstable
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
#deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

# Testing
#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
#deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free

# Experimental
#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ experimental main contrib non-free
#deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ experimental main contrib non-free
</pre>
							<p>NOTE: In this example ftp.us indicates its using USA repositories.You may edit this file, as root, to use the mirror closest to you, simply by changing the country, that is, change ftp.us to ftp.nl, or ftp.uk. Most countries have local mirrors, thus bandwidth is conserved; speeds improved.</p>

							<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/mirrors/">List of Debian Servers and mirrors current status</a>.</p>

							<p>To be able to obtain updated information on the packages APT uses a database.  This database contains the packages but also which other packages are needed for that package to work (called dependencies). The program apt-get uses this database when installing your chosen packages to resolve all the dependencies and thereby to guarantee that the chosen packages will work. The updating of this database is done by the command apt-get update.</p>

<pre># apt-get update

 		<h2>Installing a new package</h2>

							<p>Presuming the Apt-database is updated and the name of the package is known, then the following command will install a package called qemu, for example, and all its dependencies: (further on you will see how to search and find packages.)</p>

<pre># apt-get install qemu

		<h2>Deleting a package</h2>
							<p>Similarly it should come as no surprise that the following will deinstall a package, however it will not remove the dependencies: </p>
<pre>
apt-get remove gaim

	<div class="divider" id="apt-downgrade">
						<h2>Hold and/or Downgrade a package</h2>
								<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to rollback to a previous version of a package or put it on hold, due to a major bug with the latest version you have just installed.</p>
								<p>Please understand that putting packages on hold is an emergency action, that can and will fall back on you if you forget to lift the hold. This holds true even more so, if the package on hold has many dependencies. Those will go on being upgraded with the package on hold being frozen. The more important the package on hold is, the more it will hurt when it falls on your feet. So please, do yourself a favour and use hold only for short periods of time.</p>

					<h3>Hold</h3>
<pre>
echo package hold|dpkg --set-selections
</pre>
							<p>To take a package off Hold</p>
<pre>
echo package install|dpkg --set-selections
</pre>
							<p>To list packages on hold:</p>

<pre>
dpkg --get-selections | grep hold
</pre>
					<h3>Downgrading</h3>
							<p> <span class="highlight-2">Debian does not support downgrading packages. While it may work in simple cases, it could fail spectacularly for other packages. Please refer to </span><a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch02.en.html#_emergency_downgrading"> Emergency downgrading</a>.</p>

							<p>Despite the fact that it is not supportable, downgrading has been known to work for simple packages. The steps for downgrading a simple package using <span class="highlight-3">kmahjongg</span> as an example are:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>comment unstable sources in <span class="highlight-3">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list </span> with a <span class="highlight-3">#</span></li>

							<li>Add testing sources in <span class="highlight-3">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list </span>, for example:<br />
<pre>
deb http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
</pre>
							</li>

							<li>
<pre>
apt-get update
</pre>
							</li>

							<li>
<pre>
apt-get install kmahjongg/testing
</pre>
							</li>

							<li>Put the newly installed package on hold with:<br />
<pre>
echo kmahjongg hold|dpkg --set-selections
</pre>
							</li>

							<li>comment &lt;#&gt;the testing sources in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list with and uncomment the unstable sources so that you get back to using unstable sources, then:</li>

							<li>
<pre>
apt-get update
</pre>
							</li>
						</ol>

							<p>When you do want to get the latest version of the package just do this:</p>
<pre>
echo kmahjongg install|dpkg --set-selections
apt-get update
apt-get install kmahjongg
</pre>


		</div>
	<div class="divider" id="apt-upgrade">
				<h2>Upgrade of an Installed System - dist-upgrade - Overview</h2>

							<p>If the whole system is to be upgraded this is achieved through a <span class="highlight-3">dist-upgrade</span>. You should always check Current Warnings on the <a href="http://siduction.org">siduction</a> main web site, and check the warnings against the packages that your system wants to dist-upgrade. If you need to <span class="highlight-3">hold</span> a package refer to <a href="sys-admin-apt-en.htm#apt-downgrade">Downgrade and Hold a package</a></p>

							<p>An 'upgrade' only of 'debian sid' is not recommended.</p>

					<h5>Frequency of a dist-upgrade</h5>

							<p>dist-upgrade as routinely as you can, ideally once every week or two, at least 1 time per month to be safe. A dist-upgrade initiated only every 2 to 3 months should be considered the safe outer limit. For non-standard packages, or self compiled packages, you need to be much more careful with upgrading, since those may break your system at any time due to incompatibilities.</p>

							<p>After the database is updated with <span class="highlight-3">apt-get update</span>, one can find out which packages have new/newer versions: (first install apt-show-versions)</p>

<pre>
apt-show-versions -u
libpam-runtime/unstable upgradeable from 0.79-1 to 0.79-3
passwd/unstable upgradeable from 1:4.0.12-5 to 1:4.0.12-6
teclasat/unstable upgradeable from 0.7m02-1 to 0.7n01-1
libpam-modules/unstable upgradeable from 0.79-1 to 0.79-3.........
</pre>

			<p>The update of a single package including its dependencies can for example (for gcc-4.0) be done with:</p>



<pre>
apt-get install gcc-4.0
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
gcc-4.0 is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and xxx not upgraded
</pre>

					<h4>Just downloading</h4>

							<p class="highlight-3">A little known and great option to do a check for what  packages are in a dist-upgrade is the -d flag:</p>

<pre>
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade -d
</pre>
							<p>The -d allows you to download the dist-upgrade without installing it whilst in X from the konsole and allows you to do the dist-upgrade in init 3 at a later time. This also gives you the chance to check warnings against the list as it wisely gives you the option to proceed or abort like this:</p>

<pre>
apt-get dist-upgrade -d
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Calculating upgrade... Done
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  elinks-data
The following packages have been kept back:
  git-core git-gui git-svn gitk icedove libmpich1.0ldbl
The following packages will be upgraded:
  alsa-base bsdutils ceni configure-ndiswrapper debhelper
  discover1-data elinks file fuse-utils gnucash.........
35 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 6 not upgraded.
Need to get 23.4MB of archives.
After this operation, 594kB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]?<span class="highlight-3">Y </span>
</pre>
							<p><span class="highlight-3">Y </span> will download the upgraded packages without touching the installed system.</p>

							<p>After the 'dist-upgrade -d' has downloaded, and you wish to complete the dist-upgrade,  immediately or at a later time, please follow these steps:</p>

				<h3>The Reasons NOT to use anything else but apt-get or aptitude for a dist-upgrade</h3>

							<p>Package managers like adept, synaptic and kpackage  are not always able to account for the huge amount of changes which happen in Sid (depedency changes, name changes, maintainer script changes, ...).</p>

							<p>This is not the fault of the developers of those tools though, they write excellent tools for the debian stable branch, they are simply just not suitable for the very special needs of Debian Sid.</p>

							<p>Use whatever you like to search for packages, but stick with apt-get for actually installing/removing/dist-upgrading.</p>

							<p>Package managers like adept, synaptic and kpackage are at the least, non-deterministic (for complex package selection), mix that with a quickly moving target like sid and even worse an external repository of questionable quality (we don't use or recommend those,  but they're a reality on your user systems) and you will be courting disaster.</p>

							<p>The other item to note is that all of these types of GUI  package managers need to run in in X, and in doing a dist-upgrade in X, (or even an 'upgrade' which is not recommended), you will end up damaging up your system beyond repair, maybe not today or tomorrow, however in time you will.</p>

							<p>apt-get on the other hand strictly does what it is asked to do, if there is any breakage you can pinpoint and debug/ fix the cause, if apt-get wants to remove half of the system (due to library transitions) it's the admin's call (that means you) to have at least a serious look.</p>

							<p>This is the reason why debian builds use apt-get, not the other package manager tools.</p>

	<div class="divider" id="apt-cache">
			<h2>Searching for a package with apt-cache</h2>

							<p>Another very useful command in the APT-system is apt-cache; it searches the APT-Database and shows information on packages; e.g. a list of all packages, that contain or address "siduction" and "manual" is obtained by:</p>

<pre>$ apt-cache search bluewater-manual
.......
bluewater-manual-common - the official siduction manual - common files
bluewater-manual-es - the official Spanish siduction manual
bluewater-manual-de - the official German siduction manual
bluewater-manual-el - the official Greek siduction manual
bluewater-manual - the official siduction manual - all languages
bluewater-manual-pt-br - the official Brazilian Portuguese siduction manual
bluewater-manual-en - the official English siduction manual
bluewater-manual-reader - siduction manual reader
</pre>

		<p>If you want more information on a particular package, you can use:</p>
