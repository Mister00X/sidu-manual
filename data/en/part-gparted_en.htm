			<h5><span class="highlight-2">WARNING: for disk naming</span><a href="part-uuid-en.htm#uuid"> Please refer to UUID, Partition Labelling and fstab, as by default siduction uses UUID</a></h5>

			<h5>Partitioning tools may request a root password, type <span class="highlight-3">sux</span> then your password. On a Live-ISO none is set <span class="highlight-3">sux</span> then press 'enter' . See: <a href="live-mode-en.htm#rootpw" >Live Mode</a></h5>

							<p class="warning-box">Resizing the NTFS partition requires you to reboot the system immediately! DON'T DO any other operations on this partition before the reboot, otherwise you will get errors.<a href="part-gparted-en.htm#ntfs"> Please read this.</a></p>

							<p class="highlight-2">Always back-up your data!</p>

					<h3>Basics</h3>
							<p>A partition must have a filesystem. Linux knows different filesystems to use. Ext4 is the recommended format for siduction. ext2 is handy as a storage format as an MS Windows&#8482; driver is available for data-swapping. <a href="http://www.fs-driver.org/">Ext2 Installable File System For MS Windows</a>.</p>

							<p  class="highlight-2">For normal use we recommend the ext4 file system, it is the default file system for siduction .</p>

		<h2>Using KDE Partition Manager &amp; Gparted</h2>
							<p>Creating and managing partitions is not something that is typically done every day. Therefore, a good idea is to read this guide once, to get comfortable with the concepts and some of the panels that will appear.</p>

						  <h3>KDE Partition Manager - run in a terminal:</h3>
<pre>
sux
partitionmanager
</pre>
						  <h3>Gparted - run in a terminal:</h3>
<pre>
sux
gparted
</pre>


		<ul>
			<li>
							<p>When GParted or KDE Partition Manager runs , a window is opened, and drives are scanned.</p>

							<p>In KDE Partition Manager the drives are shown in a list on the left.</p>

		<div class="screenshot"><img src="../lib/images-common/images-kpart/kpart-02.png"  title="KDE Partition Manager partition information" alt="KDE Partition Manager partition information" /></div>

							<p>In Gparted, if you click the menu (at the top left), a pop down is presented. You can select to refresh the display of the drives on your system.</p>


		<div class="screenshot"><img src="../lib/images-en/gparted-en/gparted02-en.png"  title="Gparted Devices View" alt="gparted" /></div>
			</li>
		  </ul>
						<h6><span class="highlight-2">The following screenshots are of Gparted. KDE Partition Manager behaves in much the same manner.</span></h6>
		  <ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Edit</h3>
							<p>The Edit menu has three greyed out functions which may be crucial for you:<br />
							<span class="highlight-3">Undo last operations</span><br />
							<span class="highlight-3">Apply</span><br />
							<span class="highlight-3">Clear all operations</span>.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>View</h3>

					<h4>Device Information</h4>
							<p>The <span class="highlight-3">Harddisk Information</span> panel displays details about the hard disk, such as Model, Size etc. This panel is most useful in a multi harddisk system, where the information is used to confirm that the hard disk being examined is the one that is wanted.</p>
		<div class="screenshot"><img src="../lib/images-en/gparted-en/gparted03-en.png" title="Gparted Harddisk Information"  alt="operation view" /></div>

					<h4>Pending Operations</h4>
							<p>At the footing window is a list of pending operations. The information is useful as it provides an indication of a number of pending operations.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Device</h3>
							<p>Device allows you to Set a Disk label if the current disk label is inappropriate, you may change it using this option.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Partition Menu</h3>
							<p>The menu is of utmost importance. It allows you to do multiple operations, some of which are dangerous.</p>

							<p><span class="highlight-3">Delete</span> is selected if you want to delete a partition. To perform the delete, you must first select the partition.</p>

							<p><span class="highlight-3">Resize/Move</span> allows you to rezize partitions.</p>


			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Creating a new partition</h3>
							<p>On the graphical toolbar, the <span class="highlight-3">New</span> button allows you to create a new partition, if you have already selected an unallocated area. A new window appears and lets you chose the size you want, whether it be a Primary, Extended or Logical partition and the file system.</p>

		<div class="screenshot"><img src="../lib/images-en/gparted-en/gparted07-en.png"  title="Gparted New Partition" alt="file system" /></div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>If you make a mistake</h3>
							<p>If you have made a mistake you can use the Delete button to delete the chosen partition or if you haven't applied your decision to go ahead you can use the undo button.</p>

		<div class="screenshot"><img src="../lib/images-en/gparted-en/gparted04-en.png"   title="Gparted Delete" alt="delete" /></div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Resizing/Move</h3>
							<p>When you want to resize a partition you have selected, click <span class="highlight-3">Resize/Move</span> button: a new window pops up. Use the mouse to reduce (or grow) the partition or if you prefer, use the arrows.</p>

		<div class="screenshot"><img src="../lib/images-en/gparted-en/gparted05-en.png"    title="Gparted Resize" alt="resize / move" /></div>
							<p>After the Resize command has been given, click on Apply as no operations are given to the hard disk until you click Apply</p>

		<div class="screenshot"><img src="../lib/images-en/gparted-en/gparted09-en.png"     title="Gparted Apply" alt="operation view" /></div>

							<p>The duration of the operations depends on the new size of the Partition.</p>

							<p><span class="highlight-2">After manipulating the partition table please log out and reboot your system to allow siduction to reread the new partition table.</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>

	</div>
	<div class="divider" id="ntfs">
		<h2>NTFS partition Resizing</h2>

							<p class="warning-box">Resizing the NTFS partition requires you to reboot the system immediately! DON'T DO any other operations on this partition before the reboot, otherwise you will get errors.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>After the boot-up on MS Windows&#8482; the system will show a special screen, and a message asking about drive consistency : Checking file system on c :</li>

							<li>Let the AUTOCHK run: NT needs to check its file system after the resize operation.</li>

							<li>At the end of the process, the computer will automatically restart for the second time. This ensures that things run perfectly.</li>

							<li>After restart, Windows XP will be okay, but you must let the system finish the boot and wait for the login screen!</li>
						</ul>

							<p><b>Full GParted documentation: </b>To read the full documentation including, How-To copy partitions please go to <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net">GParted</a></p>

		<div class="divider" id="hd-ntfs3g">
			<h2>Writing to NTFS partitions with ntfs-3g</h2>

							<p class="highlight-2"><b>Be warned</b>: Whilst the ntfs-3g is stated to be 'stable', never use it without external backup, and of course not on production systems! If you do, it's your fault if your data gets lost, so use at your own risk!</p>

							<p>Open a shell and enter the following commands:See <a href="part-cfdisk-en.htm#disknames" >Partitioning your HD - Disk Naming</a></p>
<pre >sux
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install ntfs-3g
umount /media/xdxx
mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxyyzz[etc] /media/xdxx
To get out of the konsole type: exit
</pre>

							<p>Now your NTFS Volume should be mounted <b>rw</b> and you should be able to store data on it. But again, be warned! <span class="highlight-3">Use it in emergency situations, it is not recommended  for use on a daily basis.</span></p>
