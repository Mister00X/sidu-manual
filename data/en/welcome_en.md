## Welcome to the siduction Operating System Manual 

siduction is a wordplay  
between `sid`  and  *seduction* . <span  
class="highlight-3">sid</span> is <i>the codename of Debian's unstable  
branch.</i>

siduction is an operating system based on the  [Linux kernel](http://www.kernel.org/)  and the [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/) , with applications/programs from  [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) unstable/sid and we hold fast to the core values and  [social contract](http://www.debian.org/social_contract)  and the  [DFSG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines)  of Debian.

You no longer need to wait for a new release to always have the latest of anything, including kernels. Once you have installed siduction, followed by all your favourite programs/applications, all it needs is a  [dist-upgrade](sys-admin-apt-en.htm#apt-upgrade) , which is a system-wide software update from debian and specialist packages from siduction.

This means that re-installing yet another release every 6+ months on your PC is unnecessary with siduction, as the daily, weekly or monthly dist-upgrade brings everything up-to-date.

It is worth noting, as siduction uses Debian's unstable branch and due to the very nature of 'Sid', you will need to be prepared to use the  [Terminal/cli](term-konsole-en.htm) .

With the 'way of siduction', you will be always up to date and have the very best that siduction together with Debian 'sid' can offer.

## How to use this manual

`The siduction Operating System Manual is a reference for initial learning and refreshing your knowledge of a linux type of Operating System, not only with the basics, as it also encompasses many complex topics which will help you as the siduction system administrator.` 

<!--<div class="divider" id="man-read"></div>
Installing the `siduction-manual-reader`  to read the siduction Operating System Manual on PCs that have very small screens, such as netbooks, may be of benefit. It also provides a basic keyword search function to quickly search for files containing your search word.

#### General

This manual is divided into common sections, for example, a subject pertaining to partitioning is found in Partitioning your Hard Drive, and topics regarding the Internet/WIFI are grouped in Internet and Networking. There are some topics that cannot be grouped or require stand-alone status. 

For help with a specific program or an application (called a `package` ) that came preinstalled or that you have installed yourself, look at the website of the package help forums, FAQs and online manuals and/or a help menu within that package, to help guide you for any given program/application.

Most good programs/applications also have a help guide via <span class="highlight-3">man</span> pages in the terminal. Also check to see if documentation is in `/usr/share/doc/<package>` .

Please, if you do nothing else, take a moment to read the  [Quick Start Guide](wel-quickstart-en.htm#welcome-quick) .

 As with any new documentation there will be errors/mistakes/typos, although we hope otherwise regarding errors and mistakes (typos we can live with ) please forgive us.

As the body of work grows, more documentation will be added and we at siduction are sure that this will prove to be a very valuable resource for you and we thank you for being a part of siduction. 

##### Printing key files of the manual

Hard copy printing of key files as 'portrait' does not allow an overflow code-box to print beyond the physical paper margins, (the manual website does not have this issue due to a code-box being able to scroll across). 

While this is not generally a problem for a website, that is for example, a mainstream media site, it is rather critical for any linux distribution where a single line of code input into a terminal maybe as long as 120 characters, and thus is usually wider than a typical A4 portrait page at 12 pt.

Therefore adjust your print preferences to `landscape,` .
